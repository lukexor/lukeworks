title = "About - {title_base}"
description = """\
  My name is Lucas Petherbridge. I'm a software engineer and technology \
  enthusiast.\

  I've been fascinated with computers and technology for as long as I can \
  remember and have been coding since age 15 when I first learned about HTML \
  and CSS. I primarily use Rust these days, but I've dabbled in just about \
  everything including Perl, Ruby, Python, Golang, Java/Kotlin, C/C++, \
  Haskell, and 6502 Assembly!\

  I love learning new technologies and finding the best tools for the job. I've \
  developed a deep appreciation of problem-solving over the years, with many \
  late nights (and cups of coffee!). I am constantly looking for new projects, \
  things to learn and better ways to solve problems.\

  I'm excited about cutting-edge technologies, especially AI and machine \
  learning and I'm always on the lookout for anything I can sink my teeth \
  into. My posts here share my projects and ideas with the hope they spur \
  discussions about code, technology and software practices.\
