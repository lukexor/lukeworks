  "About": {
    "description": "I've been coding since age 15 when I first learned what HTML was.\n\nI primarily work with Javascript/React and Rust, but I've dabbled in several other technology stacks including Perl, Ruby, Python, Golang, Kotlin, C, Haskell, 6502 Assembly, and even some Arduino programming! I love learning new technologies and finding the best tool for the job. I've developed a borderline addiction to problem-solving over the years, with many late nights, refusing to go to bed until I was satisfied I had reached an acceptable solution.\n\nI am constantly looking for new projects, things to learn and better ways to solve problems. I'm excite dabout cutting-edge technologies, especially AI and Machine Learning. I'm always on the lookout for anything I can sink my teeth into. I post here to share my projects and ideas with the hope they spur discussions about code, technology and software practices."
