This website. I've had many iterations over the years, but I settled on this
design and have been really happy with it for now. It was my first project using
Python/Django and I used it to learn the framework and to learn testing out
various security measures such as a honeypot field to prevent bots from
spamming, learning how to set up HTTPS, etc. It's been a lot of fun. I've also
used it as a place to write and post about things that interest me.

My current work on this site is migrating over to a Rust/Rocket
implementation. Updates coming soon!
