An arcade classic. My original implementation of this was in Rust using my
PixEngine project, so this is a Javascript port using p5js. Came out pretty
nice! Many aspects of the program were much easier using p5js and Javascript but
I now have plenty of ideas for improvements on my PixEngine. At some point I'd
love to add more explosion particles to the ship and asteroids and other
features like random UFOs flying around. More to come!
