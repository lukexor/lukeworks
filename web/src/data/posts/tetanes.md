**TetaNES** is an emulator for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) released
in 1985, written using [Rust][] and [SDL2][].

It started as a personal curiosity that turned into a passion project to
demonstrate a proficiency in Rust and in digital sound production. It can play
most games but is still a work-in-progress. I hope to transform it into a
fully-featured and performant NES emulator. It is my hope to see a Rust emulator
rise in popularity and compete with the more popular C and C++ versions.

**TetaNES** is also meant to showcase how clean and readable
low-level Rust programs can be in addition to them having the type and
memory-safety guarantees that Rust is known for.
