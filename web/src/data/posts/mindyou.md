**MindYou** is a feature-packed task management system for
iPhone. MindYou takes the most useful ideas from top productivity methodologies
and combines them together into a single digital platform that can keep up with
you wherever you are, with whatever you're doing. Get Clear, Get Current, Get
Creative, and Get Insight. You'll get more done in less time than you ever
thought possible by keeping your mind on your tasks to keep your tasks off your
mind.

Still under development.
