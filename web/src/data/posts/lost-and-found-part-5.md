The "Lost and Found" series comes to a close. Previously, in [Part 4][] I talked
about the importance of unit testing your code. As the final chapter in this
series, I want to talk about my most recent struggle: career stagnation.

There have been a handful of moments in my career where I felt I had
plateaued. It was a point at which I wasn't learning very much day to day. The
moment that realization set in, work became a grind (at least for me). Day in
and day out, it was the same old routine. I don't know about you, but I *love*
learning new things. It's what gets me up in the morning and keeps me up late at
night. If I'm not learning, I get depressed and lazy. While this alone should be
enough motivation to avoid falling into this lethargy trap, there's another
negative side-effect. Plateauing in your career usually means you stop moving
up, or lateral, or anywhere. If you're happy with that arrangement, then read no
further. However, most of us want that next promotion, that next client, or that
fancy senior developer position at *[Insert your dream company that may or may
not rhyme with moogle here]*. Reaching those goals is almost impossible if you
hit a ceiling and fall short of their requirements[^1]. Even the most vaulted
developer at Facebook isn't going to be kept around for long if they stop
learning. The software industry just moves too quickly and will leave you in its
dust in a nanosecond if you can't keep up.

So what are you to do? It can be hard working a solid 40 hour week while
juggling any number of other responsibilities like family, a significant other,
children, or side hobbies. How are you expected to fit in career building on top
of all that? Well, the first step is deciding to make it a priority. Many people
complain about not having enough time, but time isn't the issue. We all get 24
hours a day to work with but as evident by the likes of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs,
or *[Insert your favorite software idol here]* it **is** possible to reach
heights previously unfathomable. The only difference is that they made their
goals a priority. If all this sounds like hogwash to you, let me ask you to take
a moment and think about what you prioritize your time on. Go on, I'll be here
when you get back. Got it? Good. Those things are a higher priority to you than
the things you're not spending time on. But you do them and find time somewhere
in your busy schedule. If you're saying that TV isn't a high priority, then why
are you watching it?!

The second step is easy: Start reading books related to your career, or
listening to audio books while you exercise or during your commute. All you need
is 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening, every day. Do that
and you'll burn through about one book a week which means 50 books a
year. Compare that to the average that most adults read, which is 1 book a year,
and you'll be far above the game! 50 books a year is the equivalent of a Ph.D in
your field every single year. Can you start to imagine what kind of effect that
would have on your career and your income!? There's a whole list of other things
you can do as well, but I think the first two steps will suffice in getting you
started. If you're curious about what those other things are, I highly recommend
checking out [The Miracle of Self-Discipline][] by [Brian Tracy][].
