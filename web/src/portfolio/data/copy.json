  "About": {
    "description": "I've been fascinated with computers and technology for as long as I can remember and have been coding since age 15 when I first learned about HTML and CSS.\n\nI primarily use Javascript/React and Rust these days, but I've dabbled in just about everything including Perl, Ruby, Python, Golang, Java/Kotlin, C/C++, Haskell, 6502 Assembly, and even some Arduino programming! I love learning new technologies and finding the best tool for the job. I've developed a deep appreciation of problem-solving over the years, with many late nights (and cups of coffee!).\n\nI am constantly looking for new projects, things to learn and better ways to solve problems. I'm excited about cutting-edge technologies, especially AI and Machine Learning and I'm always on the lookout for anything I can sink my teeth into. My posts here share my projects and ideas with the hope they spur discussions about code, technology and software practices."
