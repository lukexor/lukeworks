The Tetanes NES emulator, for example uses pix_engine for rendering, window and event handling.\r\nSome examples of things you can create with pix-engine:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2D ray casting of scenes or objects.</li>\r\n<li>2D games like Asteroids, Tetris, Pong, or platformers including sound effects, music and UI elements.</li>\r\n<li>User interfaces for basic applications or configuration.</li>\r\n<li>Algorithm visualizations for sorting, searching, or particle simulations.</li>\r\n<li>Image viewing and editing.</li>\r\n<li>Visual art.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nYou can check out the code on [github].\r\n\r\n[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install\r\n[sdl2]: https://www.libsdl.org/\r\n[wasm]: https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm\r\n[github]: https://github.com/lukexor/pix-engine",

You can click/touch and drag to create a fire trail. Inspired by [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alhpH6ECFvQ). Also check out this great [article](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html) about fluid simulations by Mike Ash. It's amazing how he broke down the logic and math. Of course, with Javascript we're limited in processing power, so it's not very high resolution but still really cool! It works by depositing \"dye\" with a density value at a certain (x, y) grid position and then adding some velocity to that area. Then each draw cycle, it performs a series of diffusion, projection, and advection calculations for each grid position, accounting for neighboring densities and velocities, solving linear equations based on the Navier-Stokes equations (which I do not understand). In this simplistic simulation, it's only simulating in 2D, while the equations over on Mike Ash's page are for 3D. Also, it's only simulating incompressible fluid dynamics here. There are a ton of knobs and settings that can be tweaked to get some really interesting effects!\r\n\r\nOne major problem I have and still can't figure out how to resolve is that at the point of \"dye\" deposit, there are some flickering pixels that are darker than they should be. I believe it has something to do with velocities being too high and the advection affecting them in an adverse way. Mike's article links to this [fire simulation](https://www.escapemotions.com/experiments/fluid_fire_3/index.php) that is really neat. That one is much higher resolution and doesn't suffer from the brightness issue I have. Maybe with some more tweaking I can get a nicer result but I'm pretty happy about this as it is!",

I thought it was even cooler when I found out you can draw **any** line shape using this method. Thanks to [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm2eYfj0SgA) for getting me back into this topic enough to play with my own version of it.\r\n\r\nAbove is a rough approximation of a square wave, which you can adjust using the slider to a plan sine wave by moving left, or a better square wave by moving right. You can also click and drag in the right partition of the window to draw your own shape! When you release the mouse, it'll start re-drawing it using the Discrete Fourier Transform. Pressing Escape gets you back to the sine wave demo. Neat!",

It's really enjoyable visualizing the algorithms as they loop through each iteration. So much so that I'm going to be doing a whole series of these based on various algorithms and data structures. My initial working implementation was using plain Javascript and canvas, but I've updated it to use the [ps5.js] library which will be useful later on when I get to some more advanced algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe program allows you to test various settings for maze generation including cell size and how often the algorithm will connect through when it encounters a dead-end and has to backtrack. I added the ability to download and upload saved mazes since the smaller cell sizes can take quite a long time to generate and I wanted to be able to test A* against them (and hopefully some other search algorithms soon) later on. Once a maze is generated, each time you click *Solve Maze* it will generate random starting and goal points. You can also pause/unpause the algorithm as well as adjust the frame rate for how fast it updates.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye out for more updates soon!\r\n\r\nHuge shout out to [The Coding Train] for getting me interested in visual algorithms and ps5.js!\r\n\r\n[ps5.js]: https://p5js.org/\r\n[The Coding Train]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw",

    "content": "When I was attending the University of Michigan-Flint for a few years and majoring in Environmental Science, I became heavily involved in the Environmental Science Club. There wasn't a lot of members or general interest at the time, so I ended up being Vice President and maintainer of the club website. The existing website was incredibly dated and hard to maintain, so I designed and developed a new website. It's very dated by today's standards, but it served its purpose well to keep members up-to-date on club activities and local environmental news.",

    "content": "This website. I've had many iterations over the years, but I settled on this design and have been really happy with it for now. It was my first project using Python/Django and I used it to learn the framework and to learn testing out various security measures such as a honeypot field to prevent bots from spamming, learning how to set up HTTPS, etc. It's been a lot of fun. I've also used it as a place to write and post about things that interest me.\r\n\r\nMy current work on this site is migrating over to a Rust/Rocket implementation. Updates coming soon!",
