# About

I've been fascinated with computers and technology for as long as I can remember
and have been coding since age 15 when I first learned about HTML and CSS.

I primarily use Javascript/React and Rust these days, but I've dabbled in just
about everything including Perl, Ruby, Python, Golang, Java/Kotlin, C/C++,
Haskell, 6502 Assembly, and even some Arduino programming! I love learning new
technologies and finding the best tool for the job. I've developed a deep
appreciation of problem-solving over the years, with many late nights (and cups
of coffee!).

I am constantly looking for new projects, things to learn and better ways to
solve problems. I'm excited about cutting-edge technologies, especially AI and
Machine Learning and I'm always on the lookout for anything I can sink my teeth
into. My posts here share my projects and ideas with the hope they spur
discussions about code, technology and software practices.
