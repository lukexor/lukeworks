2D Raycasting with Javascript! It's a lot of fun interacting with coding
algorithms like this. This uses some [line intersection math][] from Wikipedia,
By default it moves around randomly using the [p5js][] noise function, but you
can toggle manual mouse movement by clicking on the frame. Shout out to [The
Coding Train][] for all the awesome work he does!
