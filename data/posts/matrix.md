I absolutely loved [The Matrix][] when it came out. I can't even count how many
times I rewatched it. I used to love all the Matrix screen savers that came out
shortly after and always wondered how they did it. This was a lot of fun to
program and required a lot less code than I expected. As always the devil is in
the details and there are a lot of knobs that can be turned to tweak how the end
result looks. I'm satisfied with how it turned out! Credit goes to [The Coding
Train][] for the great tutorials.
