When I was attending the University of Michigan-Flint for a few years and
majoring in Environmental Science, I became heavily involved in the
Environmental Science Club. There wasn't a lot of members or general interest at
the time, so I ended up being Vice President and maintainer of the club
website. The existing website was incredibly dated and hard to maintain, so I
designed and developed a new website. It's very dated by today's standards, but
it served its purpose well to keep members up-to-date on club activities and
local environmental news.
