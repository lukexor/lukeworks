My software development career has been a long and insightful journey. I've
learned a lot in a short time and I'd like to share my story in this five part
series I'm titling *"Lost and Found"*. It's a tale of my meandering past;
highlighting the early days of my fascination for code and of my going astray,
only to return, years later, with an even greater passion. There were a lot of
mistakes made, but also lessons learned. Good ol' Einstein was right when he
said *"A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new"*.

I hope you follow along as the series unfolds over the next several weeks. The
software industry has such a fascinating landscape that changes almost daily,
and at an ever increasing pace as technology blooms. I'm amazed how different
the technological landscape is now compared to years ago when I got my first
computer and how different the world is because of it. Working professionally at
a software company is very different than I had imagined growing up, with more
problems to solve than software alone can tackle.

Stay tuned for [Part 1][]!
