It's taken me awhile to get around to it, but the site is up and all pages are
in a mostly complete state. There's a lot more functionality I want to add like
comments and an RSS feed but this is a good start!

I'll be posting articles about once a month to start with as I finish out the
site, and we'll see where to go from there. Happy coding!
