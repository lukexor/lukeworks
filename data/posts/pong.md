Javascript Pong! Nothing too fancy here, but some fun competition against either
the Computer or another Player. Lots more features could be added for better AI,
but it supports touch events so is somewhat mobile friendly! One of my favorite
parts of this project was adding a velocity boost to the ball if you hit it
while moving up or down. Combine that with the maximum speed a paddle can move
up or down and you get some challenging return shots!
