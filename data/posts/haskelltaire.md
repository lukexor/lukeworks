**Haskelltaire** is a simple 1-card draw game of Solitaire played
from the command line written in just 500 lines of [Haskell][]. It was done as
part of a class project in functional programming and highlights how powerful
and terse functional programming can be. The PlayingCard library can be easily
adapted and generalized to allow the creation of many other card games.
