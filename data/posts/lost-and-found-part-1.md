My descent into the world of programming started at a pretty young age. This was
back in the early days of the world wide web. Internet giants like Facebook and
Twitter weren't on the scene yet and Google was just getting started. It was a
time when [GeoCities][] was the third-most visited site on the internet[^1]. At
age 13 I had been hooked on technology for some time, having already gone
through a few flavors of Windows[^2]. I didn't start getting interested in
programming, however, until after [Windows 98][] had come out.

The computers and the advancing technology of the internet were awe-inspiring,
but they were not what got the programming ball rolling. It was, oddly enough, a
chat room. A Dungeons & Dragons chat room, to be precise. It was something my
cousin and I used to do in our spare time. We'd log in, enter chat, and roleplay
our chosen characters with other users. During one such encounter, the mage I
was talking to typed <span style="color: red">red letters</span> in the chat
window.

**I was amazed by this.** I knew that web pages had some kind way to format
text, but I had no idea how to apply it to chat. There were no formatting
options available that I could see. So, I inquired about how to turn my text
red[^3]. It wasn't CSS or Markdown or any other similar method[^4]. It was just
plain ol' HTML. Just type `<font color="red">`, type your words, and close it
with `</font>`. Simple enough!

Little did this random internet stranger know that this revelation would start
me on a path that would forever change my life and how I viewed the world. It
wasn't long before I started digging into the rest of the HTML 4.0
specification, learning CSS 2.0 and JavaScript[^5]. Somewhere along the way, I
stumbled across [Perl][] and began tinkering. I was still a big D&D fan and spent
a lot of time on www.netdragons.com playing an RPG called Vagabond's Quest[^6].

I loved the game and wanted to make my own version. **My very first programming
project was born!** I learned a lot, but looking back I'm shocked at how little
I knew. As an example, I had no concept of databases back then. My saved game
data was a text file with each line corresponding to a character and each value
separated by a vertical-pipe ( `|` ). Perl **is** great at parsing text, so it
did have that going for it!

As an outcome of all these experiences, I piqued the interest of my younger
brother, launching him on his own path towards programming as a career and I had
settled on a major for college: _Computer Science_. I didn't know it at the
time, but I was **not** prepared to major in computer science.

Not because I wasn't smart enough, or interested enough, but because I did not
fully understand what it was about. Computer Science is pretty self-explanatory,
but the experience of school vs real world application are entirely different
and I was about to learn that the hard way. I'll explain what I mean in [Part
2][]. See you there!
