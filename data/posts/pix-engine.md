**PixEngine** is a cross-platform graphics & UI library for simple games,
visualizations, digital art, and graphics applications written in [Rust][],
supporting [SDL2][] (and soon [Web-Assembly][]!) renderers.

The primary goal of this library is to be simple to setup and use for graphics
or algorithm exploration and is not meant to be as fully-featured as other,
larger graphics libraries. It is intended to be more than just a toy library,
however, and can be used to drive real applications. The Tetanes NES emulator,
for example uses pix_engine for rendering, window and event handling. Some
examples of things you can create with pix-engine:

- 2D ray casting of scenes or objects.
- 2D games like Asteroids, Tetris, Pong, or
platformers including sound effects, music and UI elements.
- User interfaces for basic applications or configuration.
- Algorithm visualizations for sorting, searching, or particle simulations.
- Image viewing and editing.
- Visual art.
