This was a class project that implements a basic IM application with Java using
a basic multi-threaded client/server protocol. Users can register, login/logout,
and chat individually with other users or broadcast messages out to all other
users currently logged in. It's a very simple application as a proof of concepts
and has not been robustly featured or tested.
