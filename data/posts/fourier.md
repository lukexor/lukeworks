I absolutely love watching visualizations. I've been following various YouTube
channels on the topic such as [3Blue1Brown][] and [SmarterEveryDay][] and
thought it was so cool to see waves represented as a series of end-to-end
pendulums navigating around a circle. I thought it was even cooler when I found
out you can draw **any** line shape using this method. Thanks to [The Coding
Train][] for getting me back into this topic enough to play with my own version
of it.

Above is a rough approximation of a square wave, which you can adjust using the
slider to a plan sine wave by moving left, or a better square wave by moving
right. You can also click and drag in the right partition of the window to draw
your own shape! When you release the mouse, it'll start re-drawing it using the
Discrete Fourier Transform. Pressing Escape gets you back to the sine wave
demo. Neat!
