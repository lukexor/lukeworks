# lukeworks.tech

My name is Lucas Petherbridge. I'm a programmer and technology enthusiast.
I also really love to code and solve problems.

This project is a website portfolio of projects and articles about things that
intrigue and inspire me. Excellence in everything is rare and it is my hope that
this site might inspire others to excellence.

## Technologies

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and relies on an API built
with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/).
