# lukeworks.tech

My name is Lucas Petherbridge. I'm a software engineer and technology enthusiast.

I've been fascinated with computers and technology for as long as I can remember
and have been coding since age 15 when I first learned about HTML and CSS. I
primarily use Rust these days, but I've dabbled in just about everything
including Perl, Ruby, Python, Golang, Java/Kotlin, C/C++,
Haskell, and 6502 Assembly!

I love learning new technologies and using the best tools for the job. I've
developed a deep appreciation of problem-solving over the years, with many late
nights (and cups of coffee!). I am constantly looking for new projects, things
to learn and better ways to solve problems.

I'm excited about cutting-edge technologies, especially AI and Machine Learning
and I'm always on the lookout for anything I can sink my teeth into. My posts
here share my projects and ideas with the hope they spur discussions about code,
technology and software practices.

This is a website portfolio of projects and blog posts about things that
intrigue and inspire me. Excellence in everything is rare and it is my hope that
this site might inspire others to excellence.

It is built using [leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) (A web-assembly
framework in Rust) and [tailwindcss](tailwindcss.com/).
